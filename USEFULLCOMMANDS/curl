-We use curl to transfer data from or to a server using one of the supported
 protocols ((DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS,  IMAP,
       IMAPS,  LDAP,  LDAPS,  POP3,  POP3S,  RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS,
       SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP))

	[Example]
	
	curl "http://picoctf.com/resources" | grep -oE "picoCTF{.*}"

	Here curl is fetching the raw webpage and we pipe this to grep to search for
	the specific matching string 
	
	-o: handles Printing only the matched parts of 
	a matching line.
	
	-E: Interpret  PATTERNS  as  extended regular expressions (EREs, see
              below)
