If we want to decode a base64 value to ASCII there are many 
posible ways to approach solving this.

1. python Script

#!/bin/bash/env python
import base64

base64data = "dGg0dF93NHNfczFtcEwz"
result = base64.b64decode(base64data)
print result


2. echo "<base64 value>" | base64 -d

   we are echo the file value to the console and piping it to base64
	-d like in the pthon script is the option to decode.


3. base64 -d <<< "<base64 value>"
	


4. This is the most common and the one to learn

	type: python to open the interpreter

	"<string value of base64 val>".decode('base64')

The process will look like this:
Python 2.7.15+ (default, Nov 28 2018, 16:27:22) 
[GCC 8.2.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> "dGg0dF93NHNfczFtcEwz".decode('base64')
'th4t_w4s_s1mpL3'
>>>
