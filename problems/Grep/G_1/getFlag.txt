Can you find the flag in file? This would be really obnoxious 
to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You 
can also find the file in 

/problems/grep-1_3_8d9cff3d178c231ab735dfef3267a1c2 on the shell server. 


[ Solution ]


	Download the file from the server and mv ~/Downloads/file to 
	where its needed. 
	
	Next, we user grep to search to file for a specific String:

		grep -oE "picoCTF{.*}" file > results.txt


[Flag]

picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_cdf2e7c2}
