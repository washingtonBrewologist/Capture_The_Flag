Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. 
Maybe they can be used to get a password to the process. Connect with 
nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 40157. Files can be found here: passwd shadow. 

[Tip for unshadowing]

       unshadow password-file shadow-file > passwordfile.txt


	The result of running cat passwordfile.txt:
	
	We now have user name and passwords hashes combined in one file.

	root:$6$HRMJoyGA$26FIgg6CU0bGUOfqFB0Qo9AE2L
	RZxG8N3H.3BK8t49wGlYbkFbxVFtGOZqVIq3qQ6k0oe
	tDbn2aVzdhuVQ6US.:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

	
	Now we can direct john to this file to see if it locates any passwords
	using out of date encryption algorythims. We can issue the commands:
	We first move rockyou.txt file into our directory. 
		
		This command will run the hashed against this password file
		
		john --wordlist=rockyou.txt passwordsFile.txt 
		
		it will tell you if anything has been cracked! --show will 
		give us the answer as output to console.

		john --crack-status --show passwordFile.txt
